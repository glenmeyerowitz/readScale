This project allows you to connect a standard digital bathroom scale to an Arduino to read the analog output. Here, I use a Walgreens Digital Glass Scale, but any other type of digital scale should have a similar procedure. 

This contains an instructions document which goes through the procedures required to connect the scale to the Arduino and the calibration steps. The code for the Arduino is also here.
